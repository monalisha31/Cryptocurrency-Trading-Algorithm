# Cryptocurrency Trading Algorithm
Algorithmic trading is a way to automate making decisions on when to buy or sell an asset based on some pre-programmed instructions and criteria. We design and implement a trading strategy and let the computer do the work for us! If the strategy is effective and well-tested, then we can potentially earn money  without having to spend hours staring at charts. This project focuses on creating a basic cryptocurrency trading algorithm in python. Cryptocurrency data is derived using yahoo finance data. The strategy used in this project is called Moving Average Crossover.
